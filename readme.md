# Yield Basis

[This](https://aaronp.github.io/yieldbasis/) is a visualisation for [yieldbasis](https://yieldbasis.com/earn)

## Graphs

This project also  containss a directory of various examples for interactor network / graph visualisations.

Many will be force-directed graphs, using various techniques or libraries which should show:

 * user-interaction: selecting nodes to show their details, moving/reshaping the nodes
 * filtering the graphs (e.g. typing filter text)

We should have a 'graph-data' directory containing a number of examples (social graphs, bi-directional graphs, asyclic graphs of hierarchies, large graphs with detailed data, graphs with lots of data about the edges). The various examples can then all provide a means to select one of the differnt data sources in that directory
